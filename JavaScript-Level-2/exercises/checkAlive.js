// If/else syntax debug
// While making a game, your partner, Greg, decided to
// create a function to check if the user is still alive
// called checkAlive.
// Unfortunately, Greg made some errors while creating the function.
// checkAlive should return true if
// the player's health is greater than 0 or false if it is 0 or below.
// The function receives one parameter health which will
// always be a whole number between -10 and 10.

// NOTE: the function name is checkAlive and it takes in one
// of type number and return a boolean.

// ** CODE HERE ** //

module.exports = checkAlive;
