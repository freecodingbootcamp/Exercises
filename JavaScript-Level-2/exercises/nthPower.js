// This exercise is from check py.checkio.org
//
// You are given an array with positive numbers and a number N. You should find the N-th power of the element in the array with the index N. If N is outside of the array, then return -1. Don't forget that the first element has the index 0.
//
// Let's look at a few examples:
//
// array = [1, 2, 3, 4] and N = 2, then the result is 3^2 == 9;
// array = [1, 2, 3] and N = 3, but N is outside of the array, so the result is -1.

// NOTE: The function name will be nthPower,
// it will take in two arguments, an array and a number.
// you can choose the names of the arguments.
// Also note that the function will return a number.

// ** CODE HERE ** //

module.exports = nthPower;
